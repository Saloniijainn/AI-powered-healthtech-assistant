## 🔄 Knowledge Transfer (KT) Sessions

To ensure continuity and onboarding, I conducted a series of KT (Knowledge Transfer) sessions covering:

- ✅ **Session 1** – RAG workflow using FAISS + OpenAI + chunking
- ✅ **Session 2** – Backend architecture and API endpoints
- ✅ **Session 3** – React frontend structure and speech integration
- ✅ **Session 4** – Prompt tuning and Human-in-the-Loop logging

KT sessions were delivered via Cisco Webex and uploaded to Google Drive for internal team reference
